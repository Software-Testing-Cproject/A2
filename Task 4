                     OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
We choosed our open source project for task 4. 
                     FRAMEWORK THEY USED FOR TESTING
Framework they used for Api testing is Spring RestTemplate and TestNG.
                     SPRING RESTTEMPLATE
What is Spring RestTemplate?
Spring 3 introduced the spring-web package, which includes the spring RestTemplate class.
The HTTPS protocol is not supported by RestTemplate, but we can use it to test HTTP-based restful web services.
Overloaded methods for various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., are provided by the RestTemplate class.
                    STEPS FOR TESTING
They followed the steps manually by using postman tool
1- #1) First, they know the endpoint of the API that they want to access.
2- They set Headers and Body for the test case.
3- They set Accept: application/JSON and Content-Type: application/JSON.
4- They set the appropriate HTTP method like POST, DELETE, PUT.a
5- They send a request to the Rest service server.
6- Using the Response Code, such as 200 OK as a success, they confirm that the response is what was anticipated.
7- Then Lastly, they compare the Response Body to their benchmark file to ensure that it is as expected.

Our Testing strategy vs Open source project testing

We have performed the UI and APi testing of selected amount of features from the open source project
while in the open source project the API testing is done only.We have adopte the Selenium framework
