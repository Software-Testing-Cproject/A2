                     OPEN SOURCE PROJECT
We choosed our open source project for task 4. 
                     FRAMEWORK THEY USED FOR TESTING
Framework they used for Api testing is Spring RestTemplate and TestNG.
                     SPRING RESTTEMPLATE
What is Spring RestTemplate?
Spring 3 introduced the spring-web package, which includes the spring RestTemplate class.
The HTTPS protocol is not supported by RestTemplate, but we can use it to test HTTP-based restful web services.
Overloaded methods for various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., are provided by the RestTemplate class.
                    STEPS FOR TESTING
They followed the steps manually by using postman tool
1- First, they know the endpoint of the API that they want to access.
2- They set Headers and Body for the test case.
3- They set Accept: application/JSON and Content-Type: application/JSON.
4- They set the appropriate HTTP method like POST, DELETE, PUT.a
5- They send a request to the Rest service server.
6- Using the Response Code, such as 200 OK as a success, they confirm that the response is what was anticipated.
7- Then Lastly, they compare the Response Body to their benchmark file to ensure that it is as expected.

------------------Setting Up TestNG framework-------------
firstly we download JDK installer (selenium-java libraries) for window 
Sencond we use ECLISE as Integrated Development Environment for our API and UI automaion Test Suite
Thirdly we run TestNG for the Eclipse ping-in

1. steps in Eclipse:
  -> select Help
  -> click on Add ->Enter http://beust.com/eclipse/
  -> select the checkbox of TestNG and click Next button
  
  
2. Project SetUp:
  -> create File -> New ->Java Project ->Name it (let suppose we named it as testSuit1)
  -> create new java package (e.g java.com)
  -> configue Built path by right clicking on lib TAB anf the add LIBRARY by selecting on the TestNG
  -> Click on Add jars button by JSO-simple jar
  
3. Test Class:
Next we create a test class which will cover CRUD(Create-Read-Update-Delete) operaions
create new class File ->New ->TestNg and named it (e.g. testOperation.java)

4. Test Method:
Fiest @BeforeMethod is executing and then eventually @AfterMethod will execute after each Test method.
The @AfterClass annotation will be executed only once after all the test methods are invoked in the class but we have not covered it in our project.
Similary @AfterGroups and @BeforeGroups test method is also not use by us.

5. Running the Tests
now we have completed our script development task ,so let run our test by clicking our testOperation.java and select option 'Run as TestNG Test'


Our Testing strategy vs Open source project testing

We have performed the UI and APi testing of selected amount of features from the open source project
while in the open source project the API testing is done only.We have adopte the Selenium framework 
along with the Rest Assured additional library.

OUR TESTING STRATEGY

UI TESTING:

For ui testing ,we have designed 3 types of main funtions:
  1-SetUp
  2-Test functions (one or many).
  3-Teardown
 
 
To search the element to be tested,we search the element by using xpath and css selector.

API TESTING:
